Some people think any government money spent in supporting the artists such as painters, musicians and poets should be spent on more important things. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

### 1. Translation

​	有些人认为政府应该给艺术家拨款，我也同意这个观点。

​       不可否认的是，似乎有一些更重要的需要政府拨款的方面。基础建设，比如道路建设，比艺术更能有效提高公民的生活品质。如果政府决定把钱花在艺术家身上，就意味着政府在想要资助其他领域的时候会面临财政预算赤字。然而，投资艺术家也有一些有利的地方。

​	首先，艺术家会产生很多好的作品。众所周知，由于需要很长时间才能创作出一些杰作来，因此艺术家们没有稳定的收入。如果政府能给这些贫穷的艺术家们钱，这些艺术家们就不用担心挨饿，至少有房子住。艺术家们没有分心的事，就能专注于创作，产生一些好的作品。

​	其次，投资与艺术可以一定程度地促进经济。如果一个城市有一些有名的音乐家和画家，这个城市就能吸引游客。游客的数量增长会给城市带来收入，因为他们住在酒店里，在饭店用餐，买展会或者音乐会的票。所以如果涌现一批有才华的艺术家，当地的经济就会得到发展。

​	总之，考虑到艺术家们会创作出一些好的作品，当地旅游业也会得到发展，当局应该给予艺术家以经济支持。



### 2. Original Text

Some people believe that governments should allocate money to artists and I also agree with this opinion.

Admittedly, it seems that other more important aspects need funding from governments. Compared to arts, infrastructure, e.g. road construction, can improve life quality of citizens more effectively. If governments decide to spend money on artists, it means that governments probably face budget deficit when they want to fund other fields. Nevertheless, there still exist more merits brought by investing money in artists.

To begin with, artists can produce more excellent pieces of works. It is acknowledged that most artists do not have stable income since it takes a long time for them to create some masterpieces. If governments can provide those impoverished artists with money, those artists do not need to worry about being hungry and, at least, they can have a house to live in. Then, without so many distractions, artists can focus on their careers and probably produce more excellent works.

In addition, investing in art can also boost the economy to some degree. If there are a large number of famous musicians or painters in a city, such a city can be attractive to tourists. Then, the increasing number of travelers can bring income to a city because they need to live in hotels, eat food in restaurants and buy tickets for a concert or an exhibition. Therefore, the local economy can also be developed if more brilliant artists appear.

To sum up, the authorities should support artists financially, considering that they are more likely to produce masterpieces and local tourism can also be developed.
