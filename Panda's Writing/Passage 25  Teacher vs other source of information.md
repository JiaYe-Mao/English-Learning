School teachers used to be the source of information; however, some people argue that teachers are not as important as before because of the increasing variety of information sources. What is your opinion.

### 1. Translation

​	说起当前时代老师的必要性, 一些人认为他们越来越不重要因为学生有了其他的信息来源, 但我不同意这个观点.

​	首先, 老师的知识具有权威性. 学生的确能从其他途径获得信息, 例如互联网, 但是每个人都能在网上发布信息, 学生遇到矛盾时很难分辨谁对谁错. 因此, 老师作为信息来源仍然是必要的, 因为他们之前获得过专业知识.

​	此外, 老师知道怎样正确的教导学生. 很多学生发现很难去开始学习一门学科因为他们从未听说过. 但是, 老师有一些完整的计划来教一些基础知识来帮助初学者降低难度. 因此, 跟着能引导学生的老师系统的学习一些知识比其他知识来源更有效和高效.

​	Furthermore, 学生可以在老师的帮助下提高实践能力. 像化学和物理这样的学科, 学生需要做一些实验来加深对一些现象的理解. 如果没有老师, 学生可能会遇到困难, 因为他们只知道这些实验的理论过程, 但没有实践经验. 例如, 如果学生错误的把一些物质放在一起, 可能会造成爆炸.

​	总结, 老师仍然是一个重要的信息来源, 考虑到他们的知识权威性, 系统的教学, 和实践技巧.

When it comes to the necessity of teachers in the current era, some people argue that they are less important because students have other sources of information, but I cannot agree with this opinion.

To begin with, knowledge of teachers is more authoritative. It is true that students could obtain knowledge from other sources, such as Internet. However, since everyone can post on websites and forums, it may be difficult for students to tell the difference between right and wrong when they encounter contradictory opinions. Thus, teachers are still necessary as a source of information since they have gained professional knowledge in advance.

In addition, teachers know how to teach students in a suitable way. Many students find it difficult when they begin to learn a new subject since they may never hear of it before. However, teachers, more often than not, will have an integrated plan of a subject and begin their teaching from some basic points to lower its difficulty for beginners. Therefore, following teachers who are potent to guide students to learn in a systematic way is more effective and efficient than other sources of information.

Furthermore, students can improve their practical skills with the help of teachers. For some subjects, such as chemistry and physics, students need to do some experiments in order to deepen the understanding of some phenomena. Without experienced teachers, students may face danger since they just know the process of experiments theoretically but do not have practical experience. For example, chemical explosions may happen if students wrongly put some materials together.

To sum up, teachers still function as a crucial source of information, considering their authoritative knowledge, systematic ways of teaching, and practical skills.
