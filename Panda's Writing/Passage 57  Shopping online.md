### 1. Translation

​	有这么一种趋势，实体店正在逐步地被网店取代。很多人认为这是一种负面的发展，不过我不同意这种观点。

​	无可否认，网购的流行会导致一定程度的高失业率。当零售商们决定在网上销售产品的时候，就意味着由于他们会选择注重网上销售，则实体店的数量会相应减少。那么，实体店就会裁员，这会使很多人失去收入来源。然而，网购也是存在一些好处的。

​	首先，顾客在交通上可以节省更多时间。城市交通拥挤，如果去远一些的店购物，顾客不得不在交通上浪费很多时间。然而，网购可以使顾客在家买东西，人们就不会受困于交通堵塞。顾客可以利用节省下的时间做他们想做的事。

​	其次，在虚拟购物中，零售商可以给顾客更多地折扣。运营一个实体店，零售商需要付房租买设备，给员工发工资，所以商品价格就要相应提升。假如他们选择在网上销售，这些费用就减少了。那么，商家就可以以低价促销他们的产品，顾客也得到实惠。

​	总之，考虑到顾客可以避免交通堵塞和用更高的折扣购物，网店取代实体店是一种积极的进步。

​	There is a tendency that physical stores are gradually substituted by online shops. Some people believe that it is a negative development, but I cannot agree with this opinion.

​	Admittedly, the popularity of online shopping leads to a high unemployment rate to some degree. When retailers decide to sell their products online, it means that the number of brick-and-mortar stores will be reduced correspondingly since retailers choose to focus on online sales. Then, employees of physical stores will be dismissed, which makes them lose the source of income. Nevertheless, there still exist several benefits acquired from online shopping.

​	To begin with, consumers can save more time in traffic. In cities where there is a heavy traffic, consumers have to waste a lot of time in traffic if they go to a store that is far away from them. However, online shopping enables users to purchase products at home, and people will not be trapped in traffic congestion. Then, with extra time saved, consumers can do whatever they want.

​	In addition, retailers can offer customers a sharp discount with virtual shopping. Running a physical store, retailers need to pay rent and utilities, as well as salaries of their employees, because of which they need to raise the price of their products. Providing that they choose to sell products online, such expenses can be cut down. Then, shoppers can promote their products at a lower price, which is beneficial for customers.

​	In sum, it is positive progress for online shopping to substitute traditional stores, considering that consumers avoid traffic congestion and purchase products with a higher discount.
