# Passage 1  Is culture worth keeping?

### 1. Translation

​	当被问到如何评价旧的行为传统时，有些人说在当今社会这应该被抛弃，但是我不能同意这个观点。

​	Admittedly，有的传统观念不应该保留，因为这些观念通常是对人类有害的。在过去，每当一些村子里的人生病，居住者可能不会向医生求助。相反，他们试图用一些传统手法来挽救病人。接着，非常可惜的是，因为这些旧观念，有些本可以痊愈的病人可能因此去世。但是，从旧观念中依然可以提炼出优点。

​	Initially，传统可被认为是文化遗产的一部分。比如在中国文化中，人们会花很久的时间来制作和吃饺子，但是一些群众任然愿意重复这些行为在一些节日。Why？因为饺子不仅起源于中国文化并且成为中国文化的代表。所以，即使是在当今，像饺子这样的传统仍然值得保留因为他们见证了历史和文化。

​	Furthermore，旧的传统应该被人们重视因为他们可以表现的更加恰当。在之前，向他人表现礼貌是值得尊敬的，例如经常向他人打招呼，非常容易被现在的人忽略。但是，如果人们意识到礼貌的重要性和必要性，他们也许会更好的和他人沟通并且更容易的扩大社交网。因此，过去的好礼仪不应该被忽视因为群众还是能从中受益的。

​	In sum，旧观念和传统应该被保留，考虑到他们为了保证旧文化的独特性以及启迪群众怎样表现的恰当。



### 2.Original Text

​	When it comes to the issue about how to evaluate orthodox ways of behavior and customs, some people may argue that those should be abandoned in the current era, but I cannot agree with this opinion.

​	Admittedly, some obsolete concepts should not be maintained since such concepts may be harmful for human beings. In the past, when some people got diseases in some tribes, residents might not ask help from doctors; instead, they attempted to rescue patients through some rituals. Then, it is pitiful that some patients who could have been cured might pass away due to such stereotypes. Nevertheless, there still exist more merits acquired from old traditions.

​	Initially, traditions could be seen as a part of cultural heritage. For example, in Chinese culture, it may take a lot of time for people to make and eat dumplings, but the public are still willing to repeat such behavior on some festivals. Why? It is because dumplings not only originate from Chinese culture but also become a representative of Chinese culture. Thus, even in the modern world, traditions like having dumplings may still be kept because they are a witness of history and culture.

​	Furthermore, old customs should be valued by individuals since they could behave more properly. Previously, it was admirable for people to show their politeness to others, such as greeting others frequently, which may be ignored by the public currently. However, if people realized the importance and necessity of civility, they would better communicate with others and enlarge their social network more easily. Thus, good manners in old times should not be disregarded for the public could still benefit from them.

​	In sum, old-fashion concepts and customs should be maintained, considering that they exist to ensure uniqueness of old cultures and enlighten citizens about how to behave more appropriately.
