# Passage 53  Young Leaders

​	Nowadays more and more young people hold important positions in the government. Some people think that it is a good thing, while others argue that it is not suitable. Discuss both views and give your opinion.



### 1. Translation

​	有人认为年轻人在政府里获得高职是积极的进步, 但其他人觉得年轻人不能承担这种责任.

​	一方面, 政府可以从年轻人的知识中获益. 相对于老人来说, 年轻一代更愿意用高科技设备并且关心科技发展. 自从越来越多的年轻人接收高等教育, 他们可以从各种渠道获取知识, 比如说互联网. 他们可以更精确的预测未来的发展, 但老年人无法完成这些, 因为他们不熟悉尖端科技. 因此, 年轻人获得高职是比较好的选择, 因为他们知道科技可以改变世界.

​	另一方面, 年轻人可能不够成熟去做决定. 广为人知的是, 那些长期身居高位的老年人能够控制他们的情感并且在大部分情况下做出最佳决定. 但是, 年轻人缺乏经验, 可能在遇到一些预料不到的困难时无法保持理性, 比如突然的恐怖袭击. 如果年轻人被个人感情左右, 他们可能会做错误决定.

​	就我而言, 让年轻人接触社会是非常必要的, 但是只让年轻人做决定会让政府效率受影响. 更好的决定是政府雇佣年轻人做领袖, 但是老年人帮助年轻人来批判的分析问题. 在达成协议之前不能下决定.



### 2. Original Text

Some people argue that it is positive progress for young people to occupy high positions in governments, but others contend that the young generation is unable to fulfill such duties.

On one hand, governments can benefit from knowledge from young people. Compared to the elderly, the current generation is more willing to use high-technology products and focus on technological development. Since more and more young people receive higher education, and they can gain knowledge from a lot of sources, such as the Internet, they can predict the future more precisely, while the elderly may not do it since they are not familiar with cutting-edge technology. Therefore, it is an optimal choice to allow young people hold important positions in governments since they know how technology can change the world.

On the other hand, young people may not be mature enough to make decisions sometimes. It is acknowledged that elder leaders who have occupied high positions for years are able to control their emotion and make optimal decisions in most conditions. However, young people, lacking life experience, probably cannot stay rational and objective when they meet some unexpected difficulties, such as a sudden terrorist attack. If young leaders are driven by their personal emotions, they will make some incorrect choices.

From my own perspective, it is important for young people to have access to higher positions in governments, but only relying on young people to make decisions will affect government effectiveness to some degree. A better solution is that governments can recruit young talents as leaders, but there must be elder officials who assist young leaders to analyze issues critically. Without a consensus between young and old leaders, a decision cannot be made.
