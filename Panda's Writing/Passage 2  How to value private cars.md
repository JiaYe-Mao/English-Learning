### 1.Translation

​	每当说起私家车变得流行和常见，一些人认为环境会因此而被破坏，但是我支持私家车会带来更多好处这个观点。

​	Initially，公众可以由私家车享受到方便的交通。当旅行者想去一些偏远地区旅游时，公共交通可能无法完全覆盖那片地区。如果好奇的游客买了一部车，他们可以自由度开去任何一个想去的地方。因此，买一辆私人车应该是头等重要的事，因为它能让游客进行个人旅行。

​	Furthermore，开车可以一定程度上帮助人们释放压力。在当今，人们被各种繁忙的事物包围，这会带来很大的压力。相应的，一些措施应该被开发出来来帮助抑郁的群众减轻心理负担。开车也是一种推荐的方式因为司机可以暂时的放松（refresh），尤其是在深夜无拘无束的开车with little intervention。

​	Admittedly，一些反对的声音可能来自一些对手，说私家车会导致环境恶化因为更多的气体，如二氧化碳，会被释放。但是，他们确实忘了一些潜在的解决手段。传统汽车确实会释放更多气体，但是现实却是电动车已经被生产并且正在很大程度上的改良。例如，Tesla变得流行因为它用电来跑并且不会导致全球变暖。因此私家车也可以变为环境友好的交通工具。

​	In sum，私家车的好处会超过在环境上的坏处，考虑到他让游客去任何想去的地方，并且提供了一种减压手段。



### 2.Original Text

​	When it comes to the phenomenon that private cars become popular and common among the public, some people may argue that the environment may suffer from such a fact, but I approve of the idea that there exist more merits for individuals if they own a private car.

​	Initially, the public may enjoy convenient traffic with their own cars. When travelers intend to go to some remote areas for a trip, public vehicles may not cover such areas completely. Providing that curious visitors bought a car, they would still be free to drive to any place they look forward to. Thus, purchasing a private car should be at the top of tourists’ agenda since it enables tourists to take their personal trips.

​	Furthermore, driving may serve to help people release their pressure to some extent. In the current era, people are occupied with heavy work, which may bring them a lot of pressure. Correspondingly, some more approaches may be developed to assist depressive people to alleviate their mental burdens. Driving is also a recommendable way since drivers could refresh themselves temporarily, especially when they drive at midnight freely with little intervention.

​	Admittedly, the refuting voice may come from the opponents that the use of private cars may lead to the deterioration of our environment since more gas, such as carbon dioxide, will be emitted. However, they are actually neglecting some possible solutions for it. It is true that traditional cars will release much gas, but the fact is that electric-power cars have been produced and promoted to a larger extent. For example, Tesla has gained its popularity since its cars run with electricity and will not contribute to global warming. Thus, private cars could also be transformed into environmentally friendly vehicles with modern technologies currently.

​	In sum, the pros acquired from driving private cars may exceed the cons on the environment, considering that it allows tourists to go to any site they like and provides citizens with a method of unloading pressure.
